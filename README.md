# Bike Rental Ridership

This is my first neural network, built from scratch, to predict the number of daily bicycle rental users. It receives the hourly rental data through a csv file. These data are separated into two sets of data, one for training and the other for validation as the network is being trained. As it deals with time series, it trains historical data and then tries to predict future data (the validation set).
